# Game
For this game project, I’ve combined the concepts of Simon Says, Tik Tok Toe, and the Dinosaur Game (like the one that appears on Google Chrome when offline) into a fun and engaging collection of mini-games.


1. Simon Says (Classic Memory Game)
Game Description: In this version of Simon Says, players must follow the instructions given by "Simon," but only if the instruction begins with the phrase "Simon says." If the instruction is given without this phrase, players must avoid performing the action. The game challenges the player’s memory, attention, and reaction time.

3. Tik Tok Toe (Tic-Tac-Toe Twist)
Game Description: This is a twist on the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, where players take turns placing either X’s or O’s on a 3x3 grid, aiming to get three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. But in this version, random events or power-ups can alter the game, making it more unpredictable.

4. Dinosaur Game (Endless Runner)
Game Description: Inspired by Google Chrome’s offline Dinosaur Game, this is an endless runner where the player controls a dinosaur that must jump over obstacles and duck under flying creatures. It tests reaction speed and concentration, with the difficulty increasing the longer the player survives.
